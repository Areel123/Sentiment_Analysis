The Sentiment Analysis Web Application is a Flask-based project designed to perform sentiment analysis on user-submitted comments. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK, the application preprocesses text by tokenizing, stemming, and removing stopwords. A logistic regression model, trained with historical data, classifies comments into sentiment categories. The user-friendly interface allows input of comments and displays the sentiment results.
Deployed on Render, a cloud platform for web applications, the deployment process includes defining dependencies in a requirements.txt file, downloading necessary NLTK data, and configuring the application to automatically open in a browser upon startup. The setup ensures a seamless user experience and easy accessibility of the sentiment analysis tool.
